# XML Enforcement Transformer

Production-style XML processing pipeline built in Python.

This tool processes enforcement parking data received as ENFO/PICT ZIP pairs via SFTP, extracts structured XML content, transforms it into a required `parkingTransaction` schema format, attaches image references, and forwards the result to a downstream endpoint.

## 🚀 Overview

The system was designed to handle structured enforcement data generated by third-party parking systems.

- Forwarded to downstream endpoint
- Archive & status tracking folders
